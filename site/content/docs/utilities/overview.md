## Utilities {.heading-xs .mt-6 .mb-2}
The Neoblaze framework includes a wide range of classes that can be used to style elements such as text, colors, layout, and more. It also includes responsive design capabilities, allowing developers to easily create web applications that look great on all devices.

Utility classes are often used to quickly apply styles to elements without having to write out the full CSS rule. They can be especially useful when you need to apply a style to multiple elements and don't want to have to write out the same rule multiple times.
